AngularJS Google Captcha Service
===================

Added  [Google Captcha Service](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) to my [AngularJS](angularjs.org) project.

This is my showcase app to show my experince with Angularjs and other jquery real productive libraries.

Site Key
------------

I have placed my site key as an html attribute.

```html
<div
    vc-recaptcha
    key="'---- YOUR PUBLIC KEY GOES HERE ----'"
></div>
```

Please note that i am using my own site key without any encryption.
In case if you want to generate for your site please refer [reCAPTCHA Docs](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html).
